# README

This application is being built as I progress in the [Ruby on Rails 4.x Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/rubyonrails/) from Jackson Pires. The plan is to release the 1.0 version when I finish the course.
If you want to be updated, stay tuned in the Releases tab.

* Ruby version 2.3.8
* Rails version 4.2.5
* For additional information take a look at the Gemfile

## TODO List

* Finish the course and release the 1.0 version
* Add PWA capabilities
* Add full Portuguese-English translations with the i18n library
* Rewrite everything with other libraries (Rails 5.x, React, Vue ? )
* (give me more ideas) 

## Contribute

## To get up and running
